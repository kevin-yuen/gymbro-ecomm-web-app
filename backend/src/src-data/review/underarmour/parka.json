      "comment": "The Men's UA Storm Armour Down Parka is perfect for cold weather, wind and even rain. The fit was spot on since I wear a medium, 5'7, 170LBS. I highly recommend it since I was looking for something that would be ideal for winter.",

      "comment": "This coat fits exactly how I wanted it to and is the perfect length. The coat is very warm as soon as you put it on and keeps you warm the entire time you are wearing it. The zipper that goes up past your neck is the first coat I've had in a long time that does not rub up against and irate my neck. I like my coat so much that I stopped looking forward to springtime.",
